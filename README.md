# Tiny "Hello, World!" in Free Pascal for Amiga

This is a silly size coding experiment, to figure out what's the smallest
executable size which is possible with the Amiga/m68k version of Free Pascal.

I got bored by some assembly fans pointing out that Free Pascal generates
"huge" executables, and I wanted to prove that if you know what you're doing,
and stick to the AmigaOS API (much like you'd do in assembly), you can actually
produce really tiny executables with Free Pascal, which can compete with most
C compilers for the same platform.

The result I've got is actually ~348~ ~308~ 304 bytes for a "Hello, world!" when
compiled for a 68000, and 292 bytes when compiled for a 68020. This difference
actually doesn't even come from the compiled code, but somehow vlink links a
slightly different binary container for the 68020. This is to be investigated.

The size could be reduced further by using the V36-only PutStr() call, and
doing some even messier hacks, but wanted something which works on every Amiga,
and it's clean enough as an example.

## So, what kind of magic is this?

Well, just what's needed. It provides an alternate version of the startup code
(`si_prc.pp`) used by Free Pascal, which bypasses the entire System unit
initialization, and jumps directly into a custom user `main` function.
Then - as none of the original unit infrastructure is being referred to by
active code - the linker just optimizes all of it away and none of it lands in 
the final executable.

## Files

* `si_prc.pp` - the custom Startup code
* `hello.pas` - a "Hello, World!" in Pascal, using direct AmigaOS function calls
* `hello`     - the example Amiga binary output (68000 version)
* `build.sh`  - cross-build script

## Requirements

Needs (means: it was only tested with)  Free Pascal current SVN trunk. Not tested
with the release version. You also need `vasm` and `vlink` for this to work.

The resulting executable should run on any Amiga.

## Disclaimer

I actually don't encourage this kind of programming. Free Pascal provides a
convenient infrastructure for high level programming needs, starting from stack
management, fast heap routines preventing system level fragmentation, advanced
file handling, threading, and much much more. None of that is available when you
write programs this way. If you try to create more complex apps, you'll also likely
to encounter various issues, which are difficult to understand and resolve, unless
you're intimately familiar with both AmigaOS and Free Pascal internals.

But it hopefully makes a point. A similar technique can be used with Free Pascal on
most operating systems, not only Amiga actually.
